## Fabric8 Vagrant Images

Try the following vagrant images to get started easily with OpenShift and Fabric8.

We highly recommend [openshift-latest](openshift-latest) but we will keep some old images around just in case you hit a regression:

* [openshift-latest](openshift-latest) for the latest OpenShift release. This might contain experimental features, too.
* [openshift-1.0.x](openshift-1.0.x) for the last known working 1.0.x release (stable)
* [openshift-0.6.x](openshift-0.6.x) for the last known working 0.6.x release (stable)

For more details see how to use the [Fabric8 Vagrant Image](http://fabric8.io/guide/getStartedVagrant.html)
