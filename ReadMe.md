## Fabric8 Installer : DEPRECATED!

**NOTE** the use of this project is now **deprecated**!

If you wish to run fabric8 locally we highly recommend using either [minikube](http://fabric8.io/guide/getStarted/minikube.html) or [minishift](http://fabric8.io/guide/getStarted/minishift.html) now! They offer the chance to use native platform hypervisors (Hyper-V on Windows, Xhyve on Mac OS X or KVM on Linux) which are much snapper and use lots less memory on your laptops!


### if you still wanna use it...

See the [vagrant images](vagrant)

There is also a nice new shiny go based installer called [gofabric8](https://github.com/fabric8io/gofabric8/) which is much easier to use and can avoid the use of Vagrant + Virtualbox
