## Fabric8 Installer

To get started using Fabric8 and Vagrant please see the [vagrant images](vagrant)

There is also a nice new shiny go based installer called [gofabric8](https://github.com/fabric8io/gofabric8/) which is used automatically by the [openshift vagrant image](vagrant/openshift)

There are also a number of useful shell scripts for working with OpenShift and Kubernetes in the [bin folder](bin)
